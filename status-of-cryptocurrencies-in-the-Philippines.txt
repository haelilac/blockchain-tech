Status of Cryptocurrency in the Philippines 


The Philippines has exhibited increasing optimism about crypto. Banko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) data shows that the volume of cryptocurrency transactions grew 362% year on year to nearly 20 million in the first half of 2021. The number of approved crypto exchanges has been increasing in the Philippines. The countryâ€™s central bank, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), has registered 13 of them so far: Betur Inc. dba Coins.ph, Rebittance Inc., Bloomsolutions Inc., Virtual Currency Philippines Inc., Etranss Remittance International Corp., Fyntegrate Inc., Zybi Tech Inc., Bexpress Inc., Coinville Phils Inc., Aba Global Philippines Inc., Bitan Moneytech Co. Ltd., Telcoin Corp., and Atomtrans Tech Corp.
These transactions, according to a report, were worth P105.93 billion. One reason is the NFT game Axie Infinity which popularized during Covid-19 pandemic. The local demand for crypto is rising, so much so that a recent study of Finder Crypto Report reported that the Philippines ranks fifth worldwide in terms of ownership, with 28% of adults saying they own cryptocurrency.
