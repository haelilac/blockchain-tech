Different focus areas/Application areas of Blockchain technology

Healthcare: blockchain can be used to securely store and share medical records, ensuring that patient data is protected and easily accessible to healthcare providers. The blockchain can be used to track the movement of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, ensuring that they are authentic and have not been tampered with.

Real estate: Blockchain technology can be applied to the real estate sector to develop a secure and transparent system for property transactions. The danger of fraud and mistakes in real estate transactions can be decreased using blockchain technology by storing and verifying property records on a decentralized ledger.
