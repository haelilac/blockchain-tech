Pros and Cons of Cryptocurrency in Environment
Some cryptocurrencies use a "proof-of-work" consensus mechanism that requires significant amounts of energy and computational power, which contributes to carbon emissions and other environmental impacts. Additionally, the process of mining cryptocurrencies can result in the consumption of vast amounts of electricity and the creation of electronic waste. Bitcoin uses the proof-of-work consensus mechanism. In this mechanism, miners use computational power to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and create new blocks in the blockchain. This process requires significant amounts of energy consumption, as miners compete to be the first to solve the problem and earn the associated rewards.
A report by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance estimated that Bitcoin mining alone consumes more energy than the entire country of Argentina. Another study by the University of New Mexico found that Bitcoin mining in China alone could generate enough greenhouse gasses to put the Paris Climate Agreement targets out of reach. Additionally, a study published in the journal Nature Climate Change found that Bitcoin could potentially contribute to a 2-degree Celsius increase in global temperatures by 2033. An article, published in the scientific journal "Joule" in 2019 by Alex de Vries, examines the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining and argues that the growing energy consumption of the network is unsustainable.
Moreover, the use of cryptocurrency can provide financial access to individuals who may not have access to traditional financial systems. It can also reduce transaction costs and improve financial inclusion, particularly in developing countries.
