Blockchain is a decentralized and digitized public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. The blockchain technology is designed to be tamper-proof making it virtually impossible to alter the data in a block without being detected. This makes the blockchain a powerful tool for creating secure and transparent systems for recording transactions and managing data. Cryptocurrency is the most popular application of blockchain technology, allowing for fast, secure, and low-cost transactions without intermediaries such as banks. Despite its good features, cryptocurrency using blockchain technology has drawbacks, such as complexity, high energy consumption, and expensive hardware. However, the adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology can have a positive impact on healthcare, real estate, and supply chain management. The effect of the cryptocurrency on the environment has positive and negative impacts that should also be considered.
