Blockchain is a digitized, decentralized, public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. Blockchain technology got its name from the way it works. The term "blockchain" refers to a chain of blocks that contain transaction data. Each block contains a set of transactions and a unique code, that is used to link it to the previous block in the chain. This creates a chain of blocks, with each block linked to the one before it and the one after it. Hence, the name "blockchain." ‘Blocks’ are the pieces of information in digital form, and ‘chain’ is the public database where this information is stored. These blocks can literally store all kinds of information from your transaction history, dates, money, time, numbers, and all else.

However, blockchain technology has some drawbacks. It can be complex and difficult to understand. Once data is recorded on a blockchain, it cannot be easily changed without a lot of effort and expense. The implementation of blockchain technology also demands a lot of processing power and expensive hardware, which requires more resources as the network grows. Developers and professionals must create, implement, and run the blockchain due to its complicated algorithms and cryptographic protocols. To execute transactions and preserve data integrity, a blockchain network requires more resources as it grows.
In terms of transparency, according to Kritikos (2018), “Enabling transparency of information is one of the biggest promises of blockchain technology, which provides a fully auditable and valid ledger of transactions. Blockchain is supposed to be a transparency machine in which anyone can join the network and, as a result, view all information on that network. Through the necessary encryption and control mechanisms, blockchain safeguards transparency by storing information in such a way that it cannot be altered without recording the changes made. Thanks to the ability of the technology to prove – in a cryptographic way – to third parties that data is immutable, it has the potential to make payments more transparent and systems more accountable. The terms of every transaction remain irrevocable, being open for inspection to everyone or to authorized auditors in ways never witnessed before.”

However, blockchain is a sophisticated technology that necessitates a high level of technical knowledge to implement and maintain. Tech hurdles may stymie blockchain technology's mainstream adoption and prevent potential consumers and developers from engaging with it. The complexity of blockchain might potentially lead to implementation problems and inefficiencies. In the context of energy consumption, the process of validating transactions on a blockchain network necessitates a large amount of computational power, which necessitates a large amount of energy. As a result, there have been concerns raised concerning carbon emissions and the environmental impact of blockchain technology. (Marr, 2023).

The adoption of cryptocurrency using blockchain technology can also have a positive impact on the environmental sector. One potential benefit of cryptocurrency is that it can enable more efficient and transparent supply chain management, which could help to reduce waste and improve sustainability in industries such as agriculture and manufacturing.
On the other hand, some cryptocurrencies use a "proof-of-work" consensus mechanism that requires significant amounts of energy and computational power, which contributes to carbon emissions and other environmental impacts. Additionally, the process of mining cryptocurrencies can result in the consumption of vast amounts of electricity and the creation of electronic waste. Bitcoin uses the proof-of-work consensus mechanism. In this mechanism, miners use computational power to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and create new blocks in the blockchain. This process requires significant amounts of energy consumption, as miners compete to be the first to solve the problem and earn the associated rewards.

A report by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance estimated that Bitcoin mining alone consumes more energy than the entire country of Argentina. Another study by the University of New Mexico found that Bitcoin mining in China alone could generate enough greenhouse gasses to put the Paris Climate Agreement targets out of reach. Additionally, a study published in the journal Nature Climate Change found that Bitcoin could potentially contribute to a 2-degree Celsius increase in global temperatures by 2033. An article, published in the scientific journal "Joule" in 2019 by Alex de Vries, examines the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining and argues that the growing energy consumption of the network is unsustainable.

Moreover, the use of cryptocurrency can provide financial access to individuals who may not have access to traditional financial systems. It can also reduce transaction costs and improve financial inclusion, particularly in developing countries.
